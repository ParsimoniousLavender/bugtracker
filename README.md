# ParsimoniousLavender bugtracker
A bug tracker for bugs of Custom ROM's based on these trees

This is the *only* place you should report bugs of the ROMs in question, in order for it to be clear which bugs exist and which don't, without spamming the Telegram group.

# How can I report a bug here?
It's quite easy. You just go ahead, hit the issues button and create a new issue *detailing the issue and* **providing logs**. Then I can take a look and try to fix the issue or pass it on to the source team.
